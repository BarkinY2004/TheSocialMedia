# The Social Media

Language used : Java

Purpose of coding the project : To improve myself in graphical user interface (GUI), design patterns and object-oriented programming.


Content of the project : This project includes the features of a simple social media application. Users have features such as opening an account, logging in and out of their accounts, sending friend requests to other users, and blocking the accounts they want. Additionally, after the user logs in, write any text as a status in the space at the top and click on the "confirm" button, and the updated status will be reflected in the bottom left section. In this way, the user updates his "story" in our language. The update notification is sent to all of the user's friends. If they want, this user's friends can click on the "show story" button and view this story. In addition, additional features such as creating groups, messaging and sending text messages make the application more useful.
